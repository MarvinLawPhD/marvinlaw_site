Marvin is a curious, driven and analytical researcher with a passion for data. He believes that it is the key to discovering patterns in behaviour and to ultimately predict and improve life outcomes. Prior to being a PhD candidate, he has worked in both academia and industry, presenting at several national
conferences, publishing empirically validated papers in high impact journals as well as leading and delivering several research projects in market research.

Marvin was selected to receive the prestigious Westpac Future Leaders Scholarship in recognition
of his drive, experience, and achievements. In his research, he will examine psychological and physiological predictors of in-lab and real-life outcomes. Marvin has learnt numerous programming languages and tools to investigate and solve questions in research and plans on extending this data-toolbox further with new, unique and exciting projects.
